# Partial application

## Definition
> Partial application is an operation that initializes a subset of a nonvariadic function’s parameters to fixed values, creating a function of smaller arity.

## Higher order functions
A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.

## Arity
Arity is the number of parameters in a function declaration.

A function with arity 1 is called "unary", a function with arity 2 is called "binary", a function with higher arity is called "n-ary". A function with indefinite arity is said to be variadic.

A common utility function in FP is the `unary`, which takes a function as an argument and returns another function that cares only about one argument:
```js
function unary(fn) {
    return function onlyOneArg(arg){
        return fn( arg );
    };
}
```

## The partial function
```js
function partial(fn, ...presetArgs) {
    return function partiallyApplied(...laterArgs){
        return fn( ...presetArgs, ...laterArgs );
    };
}
```
Partial application assigns a function’s arguments to predefined values and generates a new function of fewer arguments. The resulting function contains the fixed parameters in its closure.

### Example
```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
var add10 = partial(add, 10);
add10(2) // 12
```
By definition, the value `10` is stored in the closure of the `add10` function, namely `x` is set to `10`. When calling `add10(2)`, the second argument of `add` is given, thus its return value can be calculated.

## Chaining partial applications
Since both the first input paramter and the output of `partial` are functions, we can apply multiple partial applications to a base function. The first call to `partial` returns a function that has a few parameters set, the second returns a function that has a few more parameters set, and so on, until all the parameters have been given to the base function to run.

> The word chaining is a bit misleading in this context, and should not be confused with the concept of method chaining. That kind of partial application chaining would be achievable by defining `partial` on `Function.prototype`.

> Note, that our partial application only works from left to right as the order of applicable parameters. An analogous `partialRight` higher order function can be implemented similarly, but that is also only able to apply parameters in a sequential manner. To remedy this limitation, one can use object based partial application, but that's out of the scope of this writting.

### Example
```js
function mathPlease(a, b, c, d, e) {
	return (a + b + c) * d - e;
}

const firstTwoSet = partial(mathPlease, 2, 3);

const firstThreeSet = partial(firstTwoSet, 4);
const firstFourSet = partial(firstTwoSet, 4, 5);

console.log(firstTwoSet(4, 5, 6));   // 39
console.log(firstThreeSet(5, 6));    // 39
console.log(firstFourSet(6));        // 39
```
Examination via `console.dir` reveals how the closure nesting magic works:
- `firstTwoSet` has `2` and `3` in its closure
- `firstThreeSet` only has `4` in its closure (because it was defined as a partial application to `firstTwoSet`)
- `firstFourSet` has `4` and `5` in its closure (because it was defined as a partial application to `firstTwoSet`)

## Uses
Consider this general function:
```js
function transformAndLog(transform, logger, text) {
	logger(`Original text was "${text}". Transformed text is "${transform.call(text)}"`);
}
```
Some interesting flavors based on partial application:
```js
const upperCaseLog = partial(transformAndLog, String.prototype.toUpperCase);
const lowerCaseLog = partial(transformAndLog, String.prototype.toLowerCase);

function saveInSessionStorage (text) {
	sessionStorage.setItem('fakeLog', text);
}

const upperCaseLogToConsole = partial(upperCaseLog, console.log);
const lowerCaseLogToSessionStorage = partial(upperCaseLog, saveInSessionStorage);
```
Now you can use the `upperCaseLogToConsole` with one argument, which will be logged to the console capitalized. The `lowerCaseLogToSessionStorage` function can be used to save text lowercased into the session storage.
