# Currying

## Definition
> Currying unwinds a single higher-arity function into a series of chained unary functions.

Currying is a way to not only abstract the arity of a function but also encourages modularity and reusability.

Currying is a technique that converts a multivariable function into a stepwise sequence of unary functions by suspending or “procrastinating” its execution until all arguments have been provided, which could happen later.

currying is another case of a lexical scope (a closure) where the
returned functions are nothing more than trivial nested function wrappers to capture
the arguments for later use.

Currying is a special form of partial application where the arity is reduced to 1, with a chain of successive chained function calls, each which takes one argument. Once all arguments have been specified by these function calls, the original function is executed with all the collected arguments.

```js
function curry(fn,arity = fn.length) {
    return (function nextCurried(prevArgs){
        return function curried(nextArg){
            var args = [ ...prevArgs, nextArg ];

            if (args.length >= arity) {
                return fn( ...args );
            }
            else {
                return nextCurried( args );
            }
        };
    })( [] );
}
```
Note: If you use this implementation of curry(..) with a function that doesn't have an accurate length property, you'll need to pass the arity (the second parameter of curry(..)) to ensure curry(..) works correctly. length will be inaccurate if the function's parameter signature includes default parameter values, parameter destructuring, or is variadic with ...args

more than one argument
```js
function looseCurry(fn,arity = fn.length) {
    return (function nextCurried(prevArgs){
        return function curried(...nextArgs){
            var args = [ ...prevArgs, ...nextArgs ];

            if (args.length >= arity) {
                return fn( ...args );
            }
            else {
                return nextCurried( args );
            }
        };
    })( [] );
}
```

Tiny auto-curry:
```js
const curry = (
  f, arr = []
) => (...args) => (
  a => a.length === f.length ?
    f(...a) :
    curry(f, a)
)([...arr, ...args]);
```

## Examples
```js
function sum(...nums) {
    var total = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        total += num;
    }
    return total;
}

sum( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );                       // 15

// now with currying:
// (5 to indicate how many we should wait for)
var curriedSum = curry( sum, 5 );

curriedSum( 1 )( 2 )( 3 )( 4 )( 5 );        // 15

function curriedSum(v1) {
    return function(v2){
        return function(v3){
            return function(v4){
                return function(v5){
                    return sum( v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 );
                };
            };
        };
    };
}
```

## Uses
Currying makes it easy to create specialized versions of a more general function.

// fetchStudentFromDb :: DB -> (String -> Student)
const fetchStudentFromDb = R.curry(function (db, ssn) {
return find(db, ssn);
});
// fetchStudentFromArray :: Array -> (String -> Student)
const fetchStudentFromArray = R.curry(function (arr, ssn) {
return arr[ssn];
});

Because the functions are curried, you can separate the function definition from eval-
uation with a generic factory method findStudent, whose implementation details

could have originated from either implementation:
const findStudent = useDb ? fetchStudentFromDb(db)
: fetchStudentFromArray(arr);

findStudent('444-44-4444');
Now, findStudent can be passed to other modules without the caller knowing the
concrete implementation


```js

```

## Difference to partial application
So, unlike currying,
calling consoleLog with just one argument won’t return a new function and will
instead evaluate with the last one set to undefined. But you can continue applying
partial arguments to consoleLog by using _.partial again:

Currying is an automated way of using partial applications—this is its main difference
from partial.

> Parameters with defaults don’t count toward the function’s .length property, which will throw off utilities such as autocurry which depend on the .length value. Some curry utilities (such as lodash/curry) allow you to pass a custom arity to work around this limitation if you bump into it.
