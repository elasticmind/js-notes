# Currying

## Definition
> Currying unwinds a single higher-arity function into a series of chained unary functions.

> Currying converts a multivariable function into a stepwise sequence of unary functions.

Currying is a special form of partial application where the arity is reduced to 1, with a chain of successive chained function calls, each which takes one argument. Once all arguments have been specified by these function calls, the original function is executed with all the collected arguments.

A basic curry implementation:
```js
function curry(fn, arity = fn.length) {
    return (function nextCurried(prevArgs){
        return function curried(nextArg){
            var args = [...prevArgs, nextArg];

            if (args.length >= arity) {
                return fn(...args);
            }
            else {
                return nextCurried(args);
            }
        };
    })([]);
}
```
> Note: If you use this implementation of `curry` with a function that doesn't have an accurate `length` property, you'll need to pass the arity to ensure `curry` works correctly. The `length` property will be inaccurate if the function's parameter signature includes default parameter values, parameter destructuring, or is variadic.

A similar, alternative `looseCurry` utility can be implemented, that can take a variable number of arguments (as opposed to just one in case of `curry` above) at a time.
```js
function looseCurry(fn, arity = fn.length) {
    return (function nextCurried(prevArgs){
        return function curried(...nextArgs){
            var args = [...prevArgs, ...nextArgs];

            if (args.length >= arity) {
                return fn(...args);
            }
            else {
                return nextCurried(args);
            }
        };
    })([]);
}
```
Througout this writting, the above `curry` implementation is meant by saying currying.

## Examples
Consider the following function:
```js
function logProduct(a, b, c, d) {
    console.log(a * b * c * d);
}
```
The `curry` of this function will be a function that takes argument `a`, which will return another function that takes argument `b`, and so on, until the last argument is supplied, at which point the body of `logProduct` will be executed with the given arguments.
```js
const curriedLogProduct = curry(logProduct);

const applied1 = curriedLogProduct(1);
const applied2 = applied1(2);
const applied3 = applied2(3);
const applied4 = applied3(4);   // 24
```
Investigation via `console.dir` reveals how successive functions have closure over more and more given parameters:
```js
// Irrelevant properties are omitted for brevity
console.dir(applied1);
    [[Scopes]]: Scopes[4]
        0: Closure (nextCurried)
            prevArgs: [1]
        1: Closure (curry)
            arity: 4
            fn: ƒ logProduct(a, b, c, d)
console.dir(applied2);
    [[Scopes]]: Scopes[4]
        0: Closure (nextCurried)
            prevArgs: [1, 2]
        1: Closure (curry)
            arity: 4
            fn: ƒ logProduct(a, b, c, d)
console.dir(applied3);
    [[Scopes]]: Scopes[4]
        0: Closure (nextCurried)
            prevArgs: [1, 2, 3]
        1: Closure (curry)
            arity: 4
            fn: ƒ logProduct(a, b, c, d)
console.dir(applied4);
    undefined
```
Why is `applied4` `undefined`? Because the result of `applied3(4)` was assigned to it, at which point all the arguments became present to the curried function `curriedLogProduct`, thus the function `logProduct` was executed, which returned `undefined`.

> We mentioned when covering partial application, that an analogous `partialRight` utility can be implemented. Similarly here, both `curryRight` and `looseCurryRight` can be built, trivially from the utilities presented here.

## Uses
Currying makes it easy to create specialized versions of a more general function. Currying is a way to not only abstract the arity of a function but also encourages modularity and reusability.

Consider the following functions. One of them finds a student by Social Security Numbry in a database, the other in an array:
```js
const fetchStudentFromDb = curry(function (db, ssn) {
    return find(db, ssn);
});
const fetchStudentFromArray = curry(function (arr, ssn) {
    return arr[ssn];
});
```
Because the functions are curried, you can separate the function definition from evaluation with a generic factory method findStudent, whose implementation details could have originated from either implementation:
```js
const findStudent = useDb ? fetchStudentFromDb(db) : fetchStudentFromArray(arr);

findStudent('444-44-4444');
```
Now, findStudent can be passed to other modules without the caller knowing the concrete implementation.

## Difference to partial application
Consider an arbitrary function `f` with three arguments. If you partially apply `1` to it, the result of `partial(f, 1)` is a function, that expects one arguments. If you call it with only one argument instead (say `2`), the second argument will be implicitly set to `undefined` and the function will be evaluated, thus the result will be equivalent to calling `f(1, 2, undefined)`.

On the other hand, `curry(f)(1)` is a function that expects one argument, while `curry(f)(1)(2)` is another function, that expects one argument.

> Currying in its essence is an automated way of using partial applications.
